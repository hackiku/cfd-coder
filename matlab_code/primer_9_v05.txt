In this MATLAB code, the task is to solve the partial differential equation `u^2ux + ut = 0` using numerical methods and compare the results with an analytical solution. The code begins by discretizing space and time with `linspace` and setting `dt`, respectively. The initial condition is a step function based on the x-coordinate.

The numerical solution is computed using a while loop that increments time until `tfin`. A key part of the code is the numerical scheme: `u(2:Nx) = u0(2:Nx) - dt/dx * (u0(2:Nx).^2 -  u0(2:Nx) - u0(1:Nx-1));` This line represents the discretized form of the given PDE, with a non-linear term `(u0(2:Nx).^2)`.

An analytical solution is also calculated within the loop. It uses conditional statements to define different behaviors based on the value of x relative to t. Particularly, the `sqrt((x(i)-3)/t)` part represents the inverse relationship as per the analytical solution.

Finally, the code plots both the numerical and analytical solutions for comparison. This visual representation helps to assess the accuracy of the numerical method against the theoretical analytical solution.
