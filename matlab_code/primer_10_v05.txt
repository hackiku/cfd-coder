This MATLAB code models the behavior of an expansion wave, governed by the PDE `u_ux + u_t = 0`. The code begins by discretizing both space and time. The spatial domain ranges from `xl` to `xd`, divided into `Nx` points, while the temporal domain starts at `t = 0` and ends at `tfin`, advancing in steps of `dt`.

The initial condition is defined as a step function: `u0 = 2*(x<0) + 1*(x>=0)`, representing two distinct states based on the x-coordinate. A boundary condition `u(1) = 2` is also set, maintaining a constant value at the start of the spatial domain.

In the time-stepping loop, the numerical scheme calculates the solution `u` at each time step. The key line `u(2:Nx) = u0(2:Nx) - dt/dx * u0(2:Nx).*(u0(2:Nx) - u0(1:Nx-1))` represents the discretized version of the PDE, updating the solution based on the current and previous spatial points.

An analytical solution `ua` is also computed within the loop. The condition `if x(i) < 3/2*t` divides the spatial domain based on the relationship between `x` and `t`, reflecting the characteristics of the expansion wave.

The code concludes by plotting both the numerical and analytical solutions for visual comparison, aiding in understanding the dynamics of the expansion wave and the accuracy of the numerical method.
