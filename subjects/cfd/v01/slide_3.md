## Example 8 - Numerical Solution

**Analysis:**
- The nonlinear equation (with a convective term) is extremely challenging for numerical computation with the Finite Element Method (FEM).
- Special attention needed for dissipative and dispersive errors!

**Graphical Comparison:**
- Plots compare numerical and exact solutions at different time instances.
- At $$ t = 0.5000 $$, numerical solution starts to deviate near the discontinuity.
- At $$ t = 2.0000 $$, the numerical solution shows increased deviation but still follows the trend of the exact solution.

**Conclusion:**
- Numerical methods require careful consideration of error types to maintain solution accuracy over time.
