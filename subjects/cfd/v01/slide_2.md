## Problem 8 - Formulation

**Task:**

Solve the following partial differential equation:
\( u u_x + u_t = 0, \quad -\infty < x < \infty, \quad t > 0 \)

**Initial Condition:**
\( u(x,0) = \begin{cases} 
1, & x < 0 \\
2, & x \geq 0 
\end{cases} \)

This represents a step initial condition for the PDE, which is a common scenario in fluid dynamics simulations involving shock waves or sudden changes in flow properties.
