## Fundamental Course Goals

- Introduce students to the basics of aeronautics and the Finite Element Method (FEM) for computational calculations.
- The course is an intersection of multiple disciplines:
  - Physics (mechanics, fluid mechanics)
  - Mathematical computation (numerics)
  - Programming (a branch several decades old)
- This multidisciplinary approach equips students with a robust engineering toolkit.
- Physical laws describing quantities like fluid flow, heat transfer, or stress-strain relationships in irregular domains are expressed through Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which require specific tools for effective solving.
