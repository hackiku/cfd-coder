### Computational Fluid Dynamics: Analytical Solutions

**Topic: Solving PDEs for Fluid Flow**

**Concepts:**
- To find the solution $$ u(x, t) $$ for the domain $$ t \leq x - 3 < 4t $$, we introduce an admissible function $$ g $$ with the property $$ g = a^{-1} $$.
- This involves the transformation $$ a(u) = u^2 $$, leading to $$ u(a) = \sqrt{a} $$, and subsequently $$ g((x - x_0)/t) = \sqrt{(x - x_0)/t} $$.

**Solution Approach:**
1. Determine the admissible function $$ g $$ based on the given properties.
2. Apply the transformation to express $$ u $$ as a function of $$ a $$.
3. Solve for $$ u(x, t) $$ using the derived expressions.

**Complete Solution:**
- The comprehensive solution $$ u(x, t) $$ is piecewise-defined:
  - $$ u(x, t) = 1 $$ for $$ x - 3 < t $$
  - $$ u(x, t) = \sqrt{(x - 3)/t} $$ for $$ t \leq x - 3 < 4t $$
  - $$ u(x, t) = 2 $$ for $$ x - 3 \geq 4t $$

**Application:**
- This method is used in computational fluid dynamics to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe fluid flow, which can be modeled and simulated using numerical methods.

**Learning Tip:**
- Focus on understanding the transformation process and how it simplifies the PDE into a solvable form. Practice applying these methods to different scenarios to strengthen your understanding.
